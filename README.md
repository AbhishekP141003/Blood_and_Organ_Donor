Overview
The Campus Blood & Organ Donor Network is a digital platform designed to help students and staff within the campus easily register as donors, search for available donors, and contact them during emergencies.

This system ensures faster response during medical emergencies by connecting the right donor to the right requester at the right time — all within a trusted campus environment.

Students on campus often struggle to find blood or organ donors during emergencies. Existing solutions are slow, scattered, and lack campus-specific filtering.
The challenge is to build a simple, secure, and efficient platform where:

* Users register their blood group.
* Others can search for required donors. 
* Requesters can easily contact donors. 

Tech Stack Used

Frontend:HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or React if used)

Backend: Python Flask (or Node.js/Express — modify if needed)

Database: SQLite / MySQL / PostgreSQL

Future Enhancements:
* Real-time notification to donors
* Admin dashboard
* Verification of donors via college ID
* Emergency SOS button
* Mobile app version

Conclusion:
The Campus Blood & Organ Donor Network ensures faster help during emergencies, increases safety, and builds a reliable donor ecosystem within the campus.
This project is scalable and can be extended to multiple institutions.
